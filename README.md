## :book: DESCRIPTION
The main idea of this Project, called Moodly, is to make sure user is able to enhance or get in a mood they want. This project was useful in putting all our knowledges together as a group.  Beside the fact that we used our knowledges in Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Escalidraw, Whimsical we got to learn GitHub from the aspect of working in different branches, merging and resolving conflicts.

This app works as a mood enhancer. The user inputs any one of the moods provided on the list, then the user is provided with series of playlists and genres that can help them to either relive their mood or enhance their mood.


## :computer: USAGE
When a user inputs any mood they are in or the mood they are trying to get in, the app provides a number of playlists that contain musics that are related to the chosen mood.

### :speech_balloon: User story
As a user
I wake up feeling depressed, I go to my office where i will have to fake a smile. 1 of the things that make me smile is music but i don't know how to make a good playlist for myself. I want an application that's going to help me with music choices thats going to make me feel better every morning before i go to work. I can just listen to the playlist while getting ready for work and in my car. PS: I hate listening to the same songs all the time so i want an app that can create series of playlist.
