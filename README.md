# Mood Music Detector/Player

## An app that provides you series of songs from several artists depending on the mood you input

# Intro
This app works as a mood enhancer. The user inputs any one of the moods provided on the list, then the user is provided with series of playlists and genres that can help them to either relive their mood or enhance their mood.
This app also has a feature that shows the user the musical events/concerts happening in their environment. These events shows based on the user's location or the artist they are currently listening to.

# user Instructions

- run
# `npm i`
# `npm start`

*You might need to degrade or upgrade some dependencies for the app to run*

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# Known Issues
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
